# Faraday

[Faraday](https://lightning.engineering/posts/2020-04-02-faraday/) is a tool developed by Lightning Labs to help you extract valuable analytics and insights from your LND node.

It primarily helps users understand how capital is flowing through their node, which is useful to help identify underperforming or drained channels and where to deploy capital most efficiently.
